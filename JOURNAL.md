# June 11th-12th: Fully CADed

Started on this project by CADing everything i needed for the dog<br>
Decided to not make any crazy covers for anything, as this will be a heavily developed robot and I dont want to encumber myself with that<br>
Went with a plate in the middle and a simple two oval thing at each end for mounting the servoes<br>
On the plate, I intend to put all the power circuitry()
the leg will be 3DOF, with mg996Rs chosen for their(relative) power and cheapness<br>

I want to see if I can fit an RPi Lidar into the budget, but it looks unlikely as just printing this will cost me 6k, a 8gb pi will cost me 10k(as I want to run ROS on this doggo) assorted electronics and battery will cost me 5k<br>
Anyways, I'm fairly sure im done with cadding this bad boi, but it took me WAYYYY too long(i'm 3 redbulls deep)
**Time spent: 15hrs**

# June 13th - Schematic

Made a schematic for this doggo, as I will not be using a PCB<br>
The schematic contains 12 servoes, one pca9685 driver, the USB power board for the Pi and a GPS module<br>
**Time Spent: 1hr**
